## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to leverage on cutting-edge capabilities of blockchain technology to effectively tackle the problem of scalping in the context of popular events. We aim to utilise the blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and decentralized system that helps event organizers, ticketing agencies and consumers to effectively manage the sale and distribution of tickets without unfair competition.
