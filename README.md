## Blockchain Ticket Sale System 
The purpose of this project is to leverage on blockchain technology to effectively tackle the problem of scalping in the context of popular events. We aim to utilise the blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and decentralized system that helps event organizers, ticketing agencies and consumers to effectively manage the sale and distribution of tickets without unfair competition.
